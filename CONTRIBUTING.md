## üíª Submitting Code Changes (Pull Request Workflow)

We use the standard GitHub "Fork & Pull Request" workflow.

1.  **Fork the Repository:**
    Go to the main [EventEase repository](https://github.com/your-username/eventease) and click the "Fork" button in the top right corner. This creates a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

2.  **Clone Your Fork Locally:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/mukesh-dev-git/eventease.git](https://github.com/mukesh-dev-git/eventease.git)
    cd eventease
    ```

3.  **Add the Upstream Remote:**
    Set up a remote to the original EventEase repository to pull updates.
    ```bash
    git remote add upstream [https://github.com/mukesh-dev-git/eventease.git](https://github.com/mukesh-dev-git/eventease.git)
    ```

4.  **Sync with the Upstream (Recommended before starting work):**
    Always pull the latest changes from the original `develop` or `main` branch before creating your feature branch.
    ```bash
    git checkout develop # Or 'main', depending on the active development branch
    git pull upstream develop
    ```

5.  **Create a New Branch:**
    For each new feature or bug fix, create a new branch.
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name # For new features
    # OR
    git checkout -b bugfix/issue-number # For bug fixes, referencing the issue number
    ```

6.  **Make Your Changes & Commit:**
    * Write your code and make your changes.
    * Ensure your code adheres to our [Coding Style Guidelines](#-coding-style-guidelines).
    * Commit your changes with clear, descriptive commit messages.
        ```bash
        git add .
        git commit -m "feat: Briefly describe your feature"
        # OR
        git commit -m "fix: Briefly describe your bug fix for #issue-number"
        ```

7.  **Test Your Changes Locally:**
    **Crucially, before pushing, run the app locally (`flask run`) and thoroughly test your changes** to ensure they work as expected and haven't introduced new bugs.

8.  **Push to Your Fork:**
    ```bash
    git push origin your-branch-name
    ```

9.  **Open a Pull Request (PR):**
    * Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
    * GitHub will usually prompt you to create a Pull Request from your new branch to the `develop` (or `main`) branch of the original EventEase repository.
    * Fill out the Pull Request template with a clear summary of your changes, how to test them, and reference any related issues (e.g., `Closes #123`).
